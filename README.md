Adapter Pattern is a structural design pattern which allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together. Think of it as a translator between two incompatible interfaces, converting the interface of a class into one that a client expects. This pattern is particularly useful when you want to integrate new components into existing systems without modifying the existing code.
